with next js we can render our react application on the server or we can render it on build time, it actually gives us three different architecure models for rendering our application, we can do csr, ssr, ssg and we have to pick each one on a per route basis , it could be pretty complex but we are going to walk thru it.

CSR Usecase
In next js
In some application we might want to stall rendering until when we get to the client,
- Ecommercer app cart
- checkout page

SSR
- search
- query

SSG
-
